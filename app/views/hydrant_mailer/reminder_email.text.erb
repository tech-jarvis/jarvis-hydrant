Hello <%= @hydrant.user.name.split.first %>,

Did you remember to shovel <%= ['out', @hydrant.name, 'the'].compact.join(' ') %> fire hydrant you adopted at <%= @hydrant.street_address %>? If not, please shovel your hydrant as soon as possible!

If you've already shoveled, thank you for serving your city!

Mayor Tom Menino
