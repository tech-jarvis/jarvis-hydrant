<%= @hydrant.user.name.split.first %>,

Did you remember to shovel out <%= @hydrant.name %>, the fire hydrant you adopted at <%= @hydrant.street_address %>? If not, please shovel your hydrant as soon as possible!

If you've already shoveled out <%= @hydrant.name %>, thank you for serving your city!
